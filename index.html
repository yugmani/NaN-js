    What is NaN in JavaScript? What is its type? How can you reliably test if a
    value is equal to NaN?
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In JavaScript, NaN is a property of the global Object. In other words, it
      is a variable available in the Global scope.
    </li>
    <li>It stands for Not-A-Number but interestingly, its type is number.</li>
    <li>
      It is used to denote an object that is not or does not compute to a
      number, in a context when number operations are applied on that object.
    </li>
    <li>
      Another interesting fact about NaN is, it never equals to itself. So NaN
      == NaN or NaN === NaN is always false.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Testing for NaN:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Since a NaN is never equal to another NaN, a self-comparison of a
          value makes it the most reliable way to test if the value is NaN.
        </li>
        <li>
          Other ways to test if an object is NaN are using the isNaN() global
          method and Number.isNaN
        </li>
        <li>
          isNaN() waits for type coercion on the string before it makes the
          comparison
        </li>
        <li>So using isNaN() is not very reliable to test for NaN</li>
        <li>
          Type coercion is not present with Number.isNaN(). Instead, it compares
          the string directly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Number.isNaN() more reliable than isNaN() while testing for NaN
          values.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>
